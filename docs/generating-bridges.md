# Generating Bridge Classes

To get started, create a bridge with the `artisan make:bridge` command. Bridges usually live in the `App\Bridges`
directory. however, this can be changed through `elasticbridge.namespace` config.

##
```bash
php artisan make:bridge HotelRoom
```

## Naming Conventions
Bridges generated by the make:bridge command will be placed in the `app/Bridges` directory.
Here's a basic bridge class and some key conventions:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Bridges;

use Lacasera\ElasticBridge\ElasticBridge;

class HotelRoom extends ElasticBridge 
{
    
}
```

## Index Names

The example above is a bridge class for `HotelRoom` bridge.
By convention, just like an eloquent model, the `snake case`, `plural` name of the class will be used as the `index` name unless another name is explicitly specified.

If your bridge's corresponding elastic search index does not fit this convention, you may manually specify the index name by defining an `index` property on the model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Bridges;

use Lacasera\ElasticBridge\ElasticBridge;

class HotelRoom extends ElasticBridge 
{
    protected $index = 'hotel-rooms';
}
```
